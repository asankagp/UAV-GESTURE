# MatConvNet: CNNs for MATLAB

**MatConvNet** is a MATLAB toolbox implementing *Convolutional Neural
Networks* (CNNs) for computer vision applications. It is simple,
efficient, and can run and learn state-of-the-art CNNs. Several
example CNNs are included to classify and encode images.

> **New:** 1.0-beta11 adds the following blocks: batch normalization
> (see [`vl_nnbnorm`](mfiles/vl_nnbnorm)), spatial normalization
> ([`vl_nnspnorm`](mfiles/vl_nnspnorm), p-distance
> ([`vl_nnpdist`](mfiles/vl_nnpdist)), sigmoid
> ([`vl_nnsigmoid`](mfiles/vl_nnsigmoid)). Extends the example trainig
> code `cnn_train` to support multiple GPUs. Improves the ImageNet and
> CIFAR examples, including batch normalization for ImageNet and the
> Network in Network model for CIFAR. See also
> [Changes](about/#changes) for compatibility considerations. A faster
> and more memory efficient version of batch normalization will arrive
> soon.
>
> **New:** 1.0-beta10 establishes feature parity between platforms,
> removes some dependencies on third-party image libraries.
>
> **New:** We have added [cuDNN](install.md#cudnn) support in
> 1.0-beta9. This may have significant benefit in speed and memory
> consupmtion.
>
> **New:** There is a new introductory <a
